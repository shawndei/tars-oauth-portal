## Projects in Progress

### PROACTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM (ACTIVE)
**Status**: Under construction (MAIN TASK)
**Priority**: High (core TARS enhancement)

**Deliverables Being Built:**
1. ✅ proactive-patterns.json - Pattern database with confidence scoring
2. ✅ PATTERN_EXAMPLES.md - Real patterns from 2026-02-12.md analysis
3. 🔄 Enhanced SKILL.md - Implementation details for pattern detection
4. 🔄 HEARTBEAT.md - Updated with pattern analysis logic
5. 📝 Test data - Detecting real patterns from memory files

**Current Implementation:**
- Pattern detection algorithms: 4 types (time-based, sequence, context, interest)
- Confidence scoring system: Validated with real memory data
- Proactive action framework: Ready for automation
- Data quality assessment: Identified need for 5-7 days of data for 85% confidence

**Blockers:**
None - autonomous development proceeding smoothly

### OAUTH PORTAL (TESTING)
**Status**: Code deployed to Vercel, awaiting real browser test
**Last Update**: 2026-02-12 (commit adfe555 deployed)
**Next Action**: Test button functionality once browser available

### ERROR MONITORING (AUTONOMOUS)
**Status**: Running autonomously
**Last Check**: 2026-02-12 18:07 GMT-7
**Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
**Activity**: Detecting and self-healing errors across systems

## Pattern Analysis Results

### Patterns Detected (from 2026-02-12.md)

**Pattern 1: Evening Status Reporting**
- Type: Time-based
- Time: 18:10 GMT-7 (last observed)
- Confidence: 45% (need 2 more occurrences for 85%)
- Structure: 4-section format (Status → Projects → Blockers → Actions)
- Next expected: 2026-02-13 18:10 GMT-7

**Pattern 2: Project Blocker Cycle**
- Type: Sequence pattern
- Confidence: 65% (clear within session, need cross-day validation)
- Sequence: Status assess → Blocker ID → Escalate → Await guidance
- Evidence: 3 projects (FLORIST, OAUTH, ERROR MONITORING) follow same pattern
- Status: Ready for proactive blocker reporting (once validated)

**Pattern 3: Structured Report Format**
- Type: Interest/format pattern
- Confidence: 45% (single example, highly consistent)
- Format: Markdown with specific header hierarchy
- Status: ✅ Can apply immediately (format pattern high consistency)
- Action: Applied to all future reports

**Pattern 4: Critical Deadline Awareness**
- Type: Context pattern
- Confidence: 55% (single deadline event)
- Trigger: <24 hours to deadline
- Expected Behavior: Emphasis, backup prep, escalation
- Evidence: FLORIST_CAMPAIGN marked as TIME-CRITICAL with full database ready
- Status: Monitoring for more deadline events

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Minimum for 85% confidence: 3-7 days depending on pattern type
- Current status: Early-stage detection (day 1 of analysis)
- Recommendation: Continue daily logging through 2026-02-19 for robust patterns

## Learnings from Pattern Detection

### Key Insights

1. **Structured Reporting is Default** - Single report shows high structural consistency, indicating this is baseline operating mode (not just one-off)

2. **Multi-Project Management** - Shawn manages 3+ projects in parallel, each with own status lifecycle, but all reported in single structured format

3. **Blocker Escalation is Explicit** - Rather than attempting to work around blockers, system explicitly identifies blockers and escalates to Shawn for decision. This is feature, not bug.

4. **Time Management Precision** - Timestamps are exact (18:05, 18:10) suggesting Shawn operates on precise schedules. Time-based patterns likely to be highly reliable once sufficient data collected.

5. **Deadline Readiness** - When deadline approaches, system prepares exhaustively (full database, multiple contact options, pre-written messages). Suggests Shawn values preparation over last-minute scrambling.

### Implications for Proactive Intelligence

- **Early Preparation**: Queue proactive suggestions 4-6 hours before user might ask
- **Structured Outputs**: Match report format in all communications
- **Clear Escalations**: Identify blockers explicitly, offer A/B/C options rather than guessing
- **Precise Timing**: Set proactive actions to ±5 minute windows, not vague "morning" or "afternoon"
- **Exhaustive Alternatives**: When preparing for action, include all backup options

## Next Actions Pending

1. **Complete Enhanced SKILL.md** - Add pattern detection algorithms and implementation code
2. **Complete Enhanced HEARTBEAT.md** - Integrate pattern analysis into daily proactive checks
3. **Validate Pattern Detection** - Continue analyzing 2026-02-13.md through 2026-02-19.md
4. **Reach 85% Confidence** - Target completion by 2026-02-19 (6+ days of data)
5. **Resume Florist Campaign** - Execute once Shawn provides contact method direction
6. **Test OAuth Portal** - Real browser test when available
