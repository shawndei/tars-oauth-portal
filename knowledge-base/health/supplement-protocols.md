# Health Supplement Protocols

Data-driven supplement strategies for health optimization, shared approach between Shawn and Rachael.

## Electrolyte Awareness

**Why it matters:** Proper electrolyte balance supports:
- Energy levels
- Blood sugar stability
- Sleep quality
- Muscle function
- Cardiovascular health

### Electrolyte-Rich Foods (Preferred Sources)

| Food | Sodium (mg) | Potassium (mg) | Notes |
|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Pickles | High | Moderate | Fermented benefits |
| Bone Broth | Moderate | Moderate | Collagen + minerals |
| Potatoes | Low | 900+ | Nutrient-dense carb |
| Olives | High | Moderate | Antioxidants |
| Apricots (dried) | Low | 1500+ | Portable, sustained energy |
| Pomegranate | Low | 200+ | Polyphenols |
| Sardines | Moderate | Moderate | Omega-3s + minerals |

## General Protocol

### Shawn's Focus
- **Aesthetic goal:** Hemsworth "Extraction" physique
- **Approach:** Maximum aesthetic ROI on workouts
- **Supplementation:** Data-driven, hormone optimization interest
- **Consistency:** Structured routines

### Rachael's Focus
- **Blood sugar sensitivity:** Reactive hypoglycemia risk
- **Estrogen management:** Cycle-aware protocols
- **Sleep optimization:** Critical for fertility
- **Supplements:** Targeted for female health

## Mediterranean Eating Pattern (Shared)

- Emphasis on whole foods
- Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, fish)
- Abundant vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins
- Wine in moderation

## Key Principles

1. **Whole foods first** — Supplements complement diet, not replace
2. **Consistency matters** — Regular habits > sporadic perfection
3. **Individual variation** — What works for Shawn may differ for Rachael
4. **Data over trends** — Track biomarkers, not just feel
5. **Cost-benefit** — Don't overspend on marginal gains

## Testing & Monitoring

- Blood sugar levels (especially Rachael)
- Energy patterns throughout day
- Sleep quality metrics
- Body composition tracking
- Hormonal markers (when relevant)

## Note

Detailed supplement stacks should be reviewed with healthcare provider. This knowledge base captures macro principles and food sources; specific supplementation requires individualization.
