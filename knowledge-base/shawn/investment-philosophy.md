- **Buyback Quality** — management capital allocation signal
- **Dilution** — shareholder impact of capital structures
- **Unit Economics** — micro-level business fundamentals
- **Conservative Modeling** — building in margin of safety

## Investment Themes (Active)

### 1. Yield Curve Positioning
- Macro interest rate environment analysis

- Convexity strategies

### 2. Tail-Risk Hedges
- Portfolio insurance using derivatives
- Asymmetric payoff structures
- Probability-weighted scenarios

### 3. Dealer Gamma Dynamics
- Market microstructure understanding
- Options dealer behavior
- Liquidity provision mechanics

### 4. CTA Triggers & Systematic Flows
- Trend-following dynamics
- Quant fund behavior patterns
- Volatility regime changes

### 5. Oil & Servicing Equities

### 7. Berkshire-Style Allocation

## Decision-Making Framework

**Core Style:**
- Probabilistic thinking (scenario trees with probabilities)
- Macro + psychology + incentives integration
- Systems thinking (how parts connect)
- High agency mindset

**Expert Personas:**
- Warren Buffett (value, owner mentality)
- Stan Druckenmiller (macro, tactical flexibility)
- Option traders (risk management, asymmetry)

**Modeling Approach:**
- Base case / Bull case / Bear case scenarios
- Trigger conditions for scenario shifts
- Downside protection requirements
- Upside convexity optimization

## Risk Management

- **Conservative modeling** with margin of safety
- **Tail-risk awareness** (Taleb's Black Swan concepts)
- **Position sizing** relative to portfolio convexity
- **Rebalancing triggers** based on macro conditions
- **Hedge ratios** calibrated to comfort level

## Key Learnings

1. **Capital Allocation > Stock Picking** — How you deploy capital matters more than individual security selection
2. **Volatility is an Option** — High volatility creates opportunities for those prepared
3. **Micro + Macro Integration** — Best ideas come from combining bottom-up and top-down
4. **Probabilistic Thinking > Point Estimates** — Scenarios with probabilities beat single-point predictions
5. **Incentives Explain Everything** — Understanding what people are incentivized to do reveals market dynamics

## Current Portfolio Positioning

- Yield curve convexity plays
- Tail-risk hedges through OTM options
- Concentrated positions in resource equities (asymmetric return potential)
- Berkshire Hathaway allocation (quality, compounding, optionality)
- Options strategies for alpha generation
